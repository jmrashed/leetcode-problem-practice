# Go Programming Practice for LeetCode Problems

This is a repository for practicing Go programming language to solve LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform for technical interview preparation, and it offers a large collection of coding problems to solve.

# Requirements

Go programming language must be installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
A free account on the LeetCode platform. You can sign up at: [ https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

# How to Use

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```command
git clone https://github.com/jmrashed/go-leetcode-problem-practice.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```command
cd go-leetcode-problem-practice
```

- Choose a problem from the LeetCode platform that you want to solve.
- Create a new Go file in the src directory with the name of the problem.
- Solve the problem using Go programming language.
- Test your solution by running the program with the test cases provided by LeetCode.
- Submit your solution on the LeetCode platform and verify that it passes all the test cases.
- Repeat steps 4-8 for other problems on the LeetCode platform.

# Tips

- Before you start solving a problem, read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand the requirements and constraints.
- Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems if necessary, and solve them one by one.
- Write test cases to verify that your solution works correctly.
- Use the fmt package to print debug information to the console.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or consult the discussion forums on the LeetCode platform.
- Learn from other people's solutions and try to improve your own coding skills.
