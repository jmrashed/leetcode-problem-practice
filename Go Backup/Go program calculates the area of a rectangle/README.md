# Go Program to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
This is a simple Go program that prompts the user to input the length and width of a rectangle, calculates its area, and then displays the result on the screen.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle
	fmt.Println("Enter the length of the rectangle:")

	// Read the length from the user
	var length float64
	fmt.Scanln(&length)

	// Prompt the user to enter the width of the rectangle
	fmt.Println("Enter the width of the rectangle:")

	// Read the width from the user
	var width float64
	fmt.Scanln(&width)

	// Calculate the area of the rectangle
	area := length * width

	// Display the area of the rectangle
	fmt.Printf("The area of the rectangle with length %f and width %f is %f\n", length, width, area)
}

```

In this program, we start by importing the `fmt` package for input/output functionality.

Inside the main function, we use the `fmt.Println` function to prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle, and the `fmt.Scanln` function to read the length from the user and store it in the length variable. We repeat the same process for the width, using the width variable.

Next, we calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`, and store it in the `area` variable.

Finally, we use the `fmt.Printf` function to display the `area` of the rectangle, including the length and width in the output.

That's it! This program should allow the user to input the length and width of a rectangle and output its area.
