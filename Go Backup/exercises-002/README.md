## Input and Output

Example 01:

```command
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
```

Example 2:

```command
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

## Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
  Only one valid answer exists.
